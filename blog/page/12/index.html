          <div><p>We sailed from SB yesterday morning; was sunny &amp; calm &amp; smooth up to<br />
point conception, then a headwind and big steep waves all night.<br />
Trying to get a nap in the forward berth was like an amusement park<br />
ride, I was catching air when we went over the biggest waves! We got<br />
in to Port San Luis at 5 this morning, just beat and in need of rest<br />
and food. It is incredibly warm, no wind. Will and I just got back<br />
from getting fuel; the Coast Guard brought in a sailboat that got<br />
clobbered today - reports are of 40-knot winds through Saturday! So,<br />
(a) our choice to come up last night looks comparatively good, but (b)<br />
now we have to play it day by day and see if there's a break in the<br />
high winds. We'll definitely be here tonight, though.</p>

<p>Coming by 
Vandenberg air force base (on the coast just south Santa  Maria) last 
night in the dark was interesting - they have numerous  space &amp; 
missile launch complexes all lit up, for miles along an  otherwise 
desolate coast. I had the 10-2am watch, and enjoyed the  brilliant stars 
and bioluminescent bow waves once the half-full moon  set.</p>

<p>I woke this 
morning to find that the yummy organic nectarines I bought  fresh in SB, 
and carefully stowed in the netting slings we use to keep  all the 
produce, were dashed against the wall during the night's  adventures 
and the juice proceeded to drip all over my sleeping bag…  Bleah! Seems 
to have cleaned up nicely though.</p>

          <div><p>Took care of chores today, walking many miles in the process… Got my 
first latte in 12 days (and oh, it was good!) at Red’s cafe. We found 
a new stainless steel air pot for the boat, to replace the glass one 
that fell and broke a few days ago; I got some shorts, Alan wanted an 
iPod, and we experienced full crowd immersion after 11 days of near 
solitude. We found a laundry that we could drop our stuff off at for 
$0.75/lb, which sounded like a bargain! After picking up groceries and 
the laundry, we went to Joe’s for dinner - a wonderfully old-fashioned 
place that serve traditionally delicious food, suitable for hungry 
sailor-types.</p>

and then numbered the following days wrong. Maybe forgetting what day it is, 
is the sign of a good trip?)</p>

<p>We sailed from Santa Cruz Island over to Santa Barbara (about 25 nm) under 
delightful conditions – light wind, brilliant skies, balmy warmth. Had a 
perfect view of the lovely oil platforms cluttering up the coast… We got in 
to the Santa Barbara marina around 5, got a slip and tidied up the boat, and 
got our first showers in many days (oh, that felt sooooo good!) Went to dinner 
with Bradley. Back to the boat for a nightcap and conversation; we got to bed 
around 1 am.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">October 6, 2008</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>We went explored around Cuevo Valdez a bit - this part of Santa Cruz<br />
Island is owned by The Nature Conservancy, so some parts are posted<br />
off limits as private property. We were able to see a marvelous hidden<br />
waterfall, accessed through a sea-tunnel, as well as the sea-cave for<br />
which the cove is named. It is interesting for its three entrances<br />
into a central cave; we took the skiff into one of them.</p>

<p>The day was 
very nice and warm, and we even went for a swim after all  our hiking 
around. Soon it was happy hour, and we enjoyed some snacks  on deck and 
appreciated the calm air and pleasant sun. However, a  breeze started 
coming up as the weather shifted around to the NW -  pretty quickly, there 
was a stiff wind. We had put out both bow and  stern anchors, to steady us 
against the previous night's swell, and  now the anchor configuration 
caused the boat to turn sideways to the  freshening wind. This caused the 
bow anchor to start dragging… We  wouldn't be safe in the anchorage 
under these conditions, so we  decided to pull up the anchors and go down 
to a more protected spot  around the west end of the island.</p>

<p>Will 
started getting the skiff ready to go get the stern anchor picked  up, as 
I motored Libertine to take the strain off the bow anchor. As  Will cast 
off the skiff's stern line, the bow attachment fitting chose  that 
moment to come undone… and the skiff started going rapidly  downwind, 
much to our astonishment! Will dove in after it, and climbed  aboard. 
Fortunately, we had left the oars on the skiff, so Will could  get back to 
us… otherwise, he might still be on the island :-)</p>

<p>We eventually got both 
anchors, the skiff, and Will back on board and  departed around 6 pm under 
increasing winds.</p>

<p>We made our way down the coast of the island, with big 
wind and  following swell making for a wild ride; we finally made it to<br />
Smuggler's Cove around 11 pm, wind blowing 30 knots but offshore.<br />
There were at least a dozen other boats in the anchorage, not too bad<br />
in the daylight but tricky to navigate in the dark. We put the anchor<br />
out as close in to the beach as we could, and had some quick soup for<br />
dinner and went to bed.</p>
