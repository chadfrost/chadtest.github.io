          <div><p>We sailed under delightful conditions from Cuyler Cove northeast 
around the corner of Santa Rosa island (catching our 3rd albacore 
along the way) to anchor at Ford Point. Even in the shelter of the 
anchorage, by afternoon the wind was howling 40-50 knots, blowing the 
tops right off of the wave crests. Fortunately, it was blowing off 
shore, so we weren’t too concerned, but it sure was loud. 
We left the next morning and crossed over to the northern side of 
Santa Cruz island. We stopped to look at Painted Cave, a huge sea-cave 
over 150 ft high and 600 ft deep. Conditions were too rough to take 
the boat in the cave, though, so we continued on to Cueva Valdez, a 
pretty little cove at the foot of a wooded canyon. We have it to 
ourselves; it is quite calm this morning, a bit gray and drizzly at 
the moment but we’ll go ashore later and explore.</p>

          <div><p>We explored San Miguel Island a bit - took the skiff over to the 
beach, and hiked down the beach, then up a trail to the top of the 
bluff overlooking the bay. Discovered a marker on the bluff 
commemorating the Portugese explorer Joao Rodriguez Cabrillo, buried 
on the island in 1540. Many weird and wonderful plants there, and lots 
of seals sleeping on the beach. A volunteer ranger and his wife were 
hanging out on the beach, and we chatted with them for a bit. They 
come spend a few weeks on the island, and have it mostly to themselves.</p>

          <div><p>We departed Port San Luis at 3 am, and headed out under brilliant  starry 
skies… We found a pretty calm and relatively flat sea, and  made our way 
down the coast. Chad caught a fish, but it escaped as we  were netting it. 
Not 30 minutes later, though, we hooked another one  and managed to keep 
this one - even bigger than yesterday's fish! We  will be eating well<br />
for a few more days now (not that we weren't  eating well to begin 
with!)</p>

<p>We passed by Vandenberg AFB and could easily see the space launch<br />
facilities from an unusual perspective; we then passed several oil<br />
platforms -there aren't too many left on the California coast, but we<br />
saw most of them pretty closely. After passing point Arguello, we made<br />
for San Miguel island. Along the way, the wind picked up, and we<br />
regularly were seeing 8-9 knots as the swell helped us along.<br />
Fortunately, the crew seems to have become inured to the motion of the<br />
boat, and we could easily eat and tend to chores.</p>

<p>Approaching the 
island, we saw whales (blue whales we think) up pretty  close! We reached 
the anchorage around 5 pm, and while it's very  pretty, the wind is 
howling – we'll be keeping a close eye on the  anchor 
tonight.</p>

          <div><p>Last we heard from the intrepid sailors, they had put in to Stillwater<br />
Cove… The story resumes:</p>

<p>We set sail in the morning, figuratively 
speaking; the skies remained  grey, and winds very light. Mercifully, the 
swell was much smaller and  easier, and the fog higher, so although we 
spent most of the day and  the following night under motor-power, we were 
able to eat and  function pretty well.</p>

<p>We caught a fish on Sunday, a 
nice albacore, who gave us a delightful  dinner one night, lunch today, 
and another meal yet to come.</p>

<p>We saw lots of wildlife - some whales in the 
distance, many dolphins  and porpoises came racing over to play, including 
some at night  leaving glowing trails of bioluminescence in their 
wake.</p>

<p>This morning brought us past Moro Bay, and into Port San Luis by<br />
lunchtime. We anchored and had the aforementioned fish for lunch, then<br />
took the dinghy in to shore for a beer and a shower. We got the boat<br />
ready after dinner for the morning's passage to the Channel Islands -<br />
we will leave around 3 am, so as to arrive at San Miguel Island before<br />
tomorrow night.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">September 27, 2008</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>We made our way out the Golden Gate and right into the fog - cold,  gray 
and a big Pacific swell. Heading south, we split into two 4-hour  watches 
and made an average of about 4 knots. With the wind nearly  dead astern, 
and wind light and moving about, we had a hard time  keeping the headsail 
filled and elected  to run through the night  under just the 
mainsail.</p>

<p>No one was feeling well in the rolling swell - it was impossible 
to  eat or drink, and the fog made it very cold and damp. By morning, we<br />
were all wiped out, and decided to take a break.</p>

<p>We came in through the 
fog to Stillwater Cove, which turns out to be  right under the end of the 
famous Pebble Beach golf course! It is nice  and calm and still, we ate 
and slept up and cleaned things up on the  boat. The stars are out and 
magnificent for the moment, until the  marine layer comes back 
in.</p>

<p>We'll head out in the morning for Port San Luis, which is likely to<br />
take another 24 hours. Our run yesterday was about 105 miles, which<br />
wasn't bad given the conditions.</p>
