After (another) lengthy but
unintended hiatus from posting,
I've decided to revamp this
blog.

I've been spending too much time
reading Twitter and looking at
Instagram. Thank goodness I
never fell down the Facebook well, as the others are more than enough of
a mostly-useless time sink. 
<!--more-->

To be fair, I _do_ feel like I
have gotten quite a bit of good
from time spent surfing through
the fun, quirky and weird
terrain and personalities of
what passes for "social" these
days. But there are increasingly
too many times when I can't just
spend five minutes, and find
that an hour has been lost with
no tangible result.

I realize that almost no one
actively reads this blog; and I
don't very much care if that
changes or not. I'm writing for
me, as much as anyone. Maybe I
will post a note to Twitter when
I put something new up here -
but I might not. Doesn't really
matter.

So, I realized one other reason
(beside social media quicksand)
that I wasn't writing anything
much beyond 140 characters, was
that I've been using the Blogger
platform and it doesn't really
match how I work very well.

Blogger's great - you can throw
together a decent-looking
website with many fancy features
in nothing flat; you can even
point your own domain at it
easily enough. You're tied to
the Google tracking monster
though, and anything you want to
do with your new site, you must
accomplish through the web
interface provided.

I've considered options from
time to time - Word Press or
something, hosted on any number
of providers' servers. But I
took a step back, and really
thought about what I wanted.

I don't need an instantaneous
system that will deliver my
posts the very instant I have
composed them; I'm more
contemplative than that, most of
the time. I _do_ need to be able
to write completely off-line,
and sync up later. I want to be
able to write and manage my
website within the patterns and
tools that I use for other
writing, e.g. code and papers,
and that means using git (and
GitHub) for version management
and (usually) vim as my editor.
I like Markdown for writing
anything short of a full-up
professional paper, and even
then I will probably use
Markdown for the drafts.

A little searching pretty
quickly led me to the idea of
using GitHub's hosting feature,
Pages -- since I'm already
managing my personal projects in
GitHub, it's a natural
progression, and GitHub makes it
pretty easy.  I don't have to
worry about future portability,
since all the posts are entirely
controlled by me, written in
Markdown{% sidenote "markdown"
"Markdown is a formatting markup
standard for plain-text files. It
can be processed into many other
formats such as HTML or RTF or
LaTeX, but the original marked-up text file remains highly human-readable in its original form." %}

GitHub also makes it easy to use
Jekyll {% sidenote "jekyll"
"Jekyll is a set of Ruby scripts
that process Markdown-formatted
text files into HTML files, based
on a set of templates and the
Liquid template engine" %}, a static page generator.
You don't _have_ to - you could
put up anything you want, but
Jekyll has been around a while,
and is straightforward in what it
does.

Curiously, it wasn't until a
couple weeks into this
experiment that I ran across the
original introductory blog post
by the creator of Jekyll (and
not coincidentally, the
co-founder and former CEO of
GitHub), Tom Preston-Werner 
([Blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html))
in which he lays out _his_
rationale for creating Jekyll...
which turns out to be almost
identical to mine. Thus, I
stumbled into what seems to be a
tailor-made solution.  The suit
was tailored for someone else,
but happens to fit remarkably
well.
