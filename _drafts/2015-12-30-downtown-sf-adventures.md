We elected to go on a multi-modal (car, CalTrain, feet, BART, car) adventure to
downtown San Francisco for our pre-Christmas outing this year. We took in the
sights, took the escalators to *every* floor of Macy's (both mens' and womens'
stores), went to the [ACT's](http://www.act-sf.org/) production of Dickens'
Christmas Carol, had a spectacularly delicious dinner at
[Bouche](http://www.bouchesf.com/), and generally had a jolly and festive time.

Nimue got to look at kittens (KITTENS!) in the Macy's display windows, while we
fended off the kindly animal shelter volunteers seeking kitten adoptees with
cries of "we already have two!"

No trip to downtown SF at Christmas time would be complete without visiting the
giant tree set up in the plaza, and a kindly European girl with a bike snapped a
picture of us.
